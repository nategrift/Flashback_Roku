# Design Information

## Description
The style of this application is similar to Roku and designed to look like a TV sort of application but on a the web. The design is primarily blue for the background, with red as an accent color.  White was used for the text to make a nice contrast.

A kid theme was added for the kids profile.  The theme is similar to the overall application to provide consistancy.  A few differences are:

  - More rounded movies being displayed
  - Dramatically reduced amount of information on screen
  - Removed lots of unneccessary content for kids.  
  - Hid ability to add comments on client side.
  - Made buttons more obvious
  - Added clear `Flashback Kids` stamp in top right corner
