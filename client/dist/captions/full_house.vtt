00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.900
(Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh)

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.110
Whatever happened to predictability

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.810
The milkman, the paperboy, evening TV?

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.810
How did I get delivered here?
Somebody tell me, please

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.810
This old world's confusing me

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.010
With clouds as mean as you've ever seen

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.010
Ain't a bird who knows your tune.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.010
Then a little voice inside you whispers,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.010
"Kid don't sell your dreams, so soon."

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.010
Everywhere you look
(Everywhere you look)

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.710
There's a heart
(There's a heart)

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.710
A hand to hold onto

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.910
Everywhere you look
(Everywhere you look)

00:00:57.915 --> 00:01:00.310
There's a face

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.610
Of somebody who needs you

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.610
Everywhere you look

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.810
When you're lost out there
and you're all alone,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.510
A light is waiting
to carry you home.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.810
Everywhere you look

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.610
